              <p class="subtextcol">Topic 1</p>
              <p class="subsubtextcol">Learning about the Zeroth Generation taught me how computing started with simple mechanical tools like the abacus, eventually evolving into today’s powerful technology. Each era, from vacuum tubes to integrated circuits, built on the last, driving innovation and transforming society. It’s amazing to see how these advancements shaped industries and opened doors for future breakthroughs, reminding me that even small steps can lead to big changes.</p>

              <h2 class="heading-content">Information Processing Cycle</h2>
              <p class="subtextcol">Topic 2</p>
              <p class="subsubtextcol">Understanding the Information Processing Cycle really helped me grasp how data turns into meaningful information. It starts with input, where data is collected and validated. Then, the computer processes it, stores it, and finally outputs it in a way that's useful to the user. I also learned that data is just raw facts, while information is processed data that has value for decision-making. This cycle is essential for turning simple data into something actionable, and knowing how each step works makes me appreciate how systems organize and handle information.</p>

              <h2 class="heading-content">Introduction to Computer Systems</h2>
              <p class="subtextcol">Topic 3</p>
              <p class="subsubtextcol">I learned a lot about computer systems in this topic! It’s basically about how everything works together: hardware, software, people, and data. Hardware is all the physical stuff like input devices (keyboards), output devices (monitors), and storage. Software tells the computer what to do, and it comes in two types: system software (like the operating system) and application software (like word processors or games). People are the ones who use the computers, and data ware helps manage all the data that gets processed. All these parts work together to make the computer useful and efficient.</p>

              <h2 class="heading-content">Basic Concept of Computer Security</h2>
              <p class="subtextcol">Topic 4</p>
              <p class="subsubtextcol">This topic really opened my eyes to the importance of computer security. I learned that securing data is crucial to preventing cybercrimes like identity theft, hacking, and cyberbullying. For example, encrypting sensitive files before sending them is necessary to protect personal data. I also discovered the different types of cybercriminals, such as hackers (both white and black hats) and scammers, who use various methods like phishing to steal information.
                Understanding the countermeasures like encryption, firewalls, and proxies was also enlightening. These tools are essential in defending against attacks and protecting both personal and business data. Cybersecurity is all about being proactive—whether it's classifying information, securing personal details, or using the right software to prevent attacks.</p>

              <h2 class="heading-content">The Internet and World Wide Web</h2>
              <p class="subtextcol">Topic 5</p>
              <p class="subsubtextcol">I learned about that the Internet is a vast network that encompasses various tools and technologies, such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, chat rooms, and file transfer protocols. Cloud computing offers flexible, remote access to data and applications, benefiting businesses by reducing the need for in-house data centers. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, allows systems to learn and adapt from data, while neural networks improve performance in tasks like speech and image recognition. The Internet of Things connects devices to collect and exchange data, enhancing efficiency in areas like healthcare and manufacturing. Common Internet uses include communication through email and chat, research for a variety of fields, and publishing via the World Wide Web. Social media platforms allow users to share content and engage with others through different forms, such as social networking sites, image and video sharing, and community blogs.</p>

              <h2 class="heading-content">Basic HTML and CSS</h2>
              <p class="subtextcol">Topic 6</p>
              <p class="subsubtextcol">In this topic, I learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, which are essential for creating and styling web pages. HTML provides the structure of a page using tags like h1, p, and img, which organize content, while CSS is used to style those elements by adjusting their color, size, and layout. I also discovered different ways to apply CSS—inline, internal, and external—and how selectors target specific HTML elements for styling. Additionally, I learned the difference between CSS, which handles the visual aspects, and JavaScript, which adds interactivity. The topic also introduced wireframes and mockups, with wireframes being simple layouts for planning structure and mockups being more detailed visual representations for refining design. This chapter gave me a solid foundation in web development, covering both the structure and appearance of websites.</p>

                <h3>ZEROTH GENERATION: MECHANICAL ERA</h3>
                <p>September 2, 2024</p><br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In this activity, we were given a task to create an infographic for the Mechanical Era summarizing its key developments, notable figures, and the impact of the era on society and industries. I was the one who created our infographic using Photoshop. I decided to use brown shades because it complements the color of the inventions. I enjoyed making this infographic.</p>

                <p>September 15, 2024</p><br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In this activity, we were given a task to research and analyze one famous cybercrime case that happened here in the Philippines. We took Lontok's case, which happened in the year 2016. Lontok's case is indeed horrifying, and it suggests that we should never share our personal information on social media because there are identity thieves who may put us at risk. Social media users should be aware that personal information should be kept private to avoid identity theft.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">This was our first activity in HTML. We learned about the basics and the various HTML tags, such as h1 to h6 tags and unordered and ordered lists. I already learned HTML before; when Ma'am Glaiza first discusses this, it feels like I am back to learning HTML again.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">In this activity, we made 3 wireframes for our portfolio website. These 3 wireframes are for the Home Page, IT111 Blog Entries, and Flex Page.

                <p>November 9, 2024</p><br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In this activity, we were given a task to conduct a cross-analysis on the interdependencies, shared trends, and distinct developments within cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things
                  (IoT). We were given the freedom to choose our groupmates, and I liked this activity because I learned so much about cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things.</p>

      <h1>HIGHLIGHT OF MY <span class="gradient-text">FAVORITE LESSON</span></h1>
      <div class="container-highlight">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic 6 HTML and CSS is my favorite topic of the subject so far. I learned HTML and CSS back in senior high school, and I am so happy that I got to learn the basics again. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure web pages with elements represented by tags that define content like headings, paragraphs, and images. Key tags such as html, head, title, and body organize the page, while others like h1 to h6, p, and img structure the content. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling HTML elements, controlling aspects like color, size, and layout, and can be added via inline, internal, or external styles. CSS selectors target specific elements by name, ID, or class to apply styles, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. Wireframes and mockups are design tools used to plan the layout and visualize the final product, with wireframes focusing on structure and mockups providing a more detailed, polished visual representation.</p>
